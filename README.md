# EXPRESS
EXPLORING THE BACKEND
Also added some programatic data insertion into the remote mongodb database 

To test the web api kindly install depencies 
`npm install`

To run data insertion programatically run
`node ./app/data/programaticDataInsertion.js --delete` to first clean up data from the database, them run
`node ./app/data/programaticDataInsertion.js --import` to import local data into the remote database

That's all
